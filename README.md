### The Strategy Plane

For my personal project 4 with [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) I decided to tackle a simple yet very annoying and persistent problem my partner and I encounter on a weekly basis - picking a movie or a new TV show to watch on a sunday.
Even thought I'm sure we're not the only ones having this problem, I conducted several interviews to get an idea of how others go about deciding what the next movie they are going to watch is and if that's an issue for them also. These were some of the questions I asked:
* How often do you watch movies / TV shows? 
* What streaming providers are you using in your household?
* Do you find it difficult to pick your next watch?
* How much time do you think you spend picking a movie / TV show?
* Does this event cause any friction between you and your partner / family?
* What are your methods of picking a movie?

These are my findings:
* Most people I've spoken to watch movies / TV shows on a weekly basis.
* Most of them use one of the big streaming providers (Netflix, Amason Prime), some use 'of the market' free alternatives.
* Having to pick a movie is a problem of varying degree for different people, however the problem does arise at least sometimes and is some cases can cause arguments.
* The note worthy methods for picking your next watch were:
    * scrolling through different list on the streaming provider of choice
    * friends suggestions
    * using the search features to look for a specific actor / year of release

#### Problem Statement

"I'm a movie lover who wants a simple solution to be able to pick my next watch quickly, but I'm not able to do so, because of endless options available and lack of decisiveness, which at times can cause arguments in my household"

#### Target Audience

This website is for anyone who loves watching movies or TV shows and who at any time runs into an issue of actually pcking their next watch.

#### Competitor Analysis

To give me a better understanding of what my website would actually look like and where I could have an edge in, I've looked into 2 types of services.

##### Big name streaming providers

* Hight quality and well structured. +
* Full streaming service and good selection. +
* Narrowing down the offerrings to lists (like 'Popular') is good, but doesn't solve the issue we're trying to adress. +-
* No way to check for movies available on other platforms. -

##### Movie / TV show tracker websites

These are websites that access wast amounts of movie data by utilizing API's. A couple stood out from the ones I've investigated. Notably [MovieOfTheNight](https://www.movieofthenight.com/) and [Reelgood](https://reelgood.com/) latter of which is far more developed and has a movie randomiser feature I'm in search of. How ever I feel theres alot more functionality that could be added which would benefit the user. These would be my direct competitors.
